# Emoji Toolbox

`emoji-toolbox` is a toolbox full of handy features for developers who want to use emojis in their code or documentation more often 😃.

## Features

- Replace text with a fitting emoji
- Insert an emoji from a list of emoticons
- Replace an ASCII emoji with its "real" emoji counterpart
- Replace anything you have selected.

## Usage

### Convert

- Select a text or ASCII emoji
- Open the command palette (`ctrl`+ `shift` + `p` or `F1` or `View` -> `Command Palette...`)
- Select an action
  - **Convert ASCII to emoji** - converts an ASCII emoji, like ":)" to a "real" emoji like 😃
  - **Convert text to emoji** - converts given text to a fitting emoji (wink -> 😉 | mad -> 😠)
  - **Convert anything to emoji** - tries to convert the selected content to an emoji

**Please only select one word or ASCII emoji at a time when converting. Otherwise, it will fail. (Support for this may come in the future.)**

> You might get a dropdown with multiple emojis to choose from whenever multiple emojis are connected with one word. (e.g. meh can result in 😐 and 😒)

### Insert

- Position your cursor where you want to insert an emoji
- Open the command palette (`ctrl`+ `shift` + `p` or `F1` or `View` -> `Command Palette...`)
- Choose **Insert emoji**
- Pick an emoji you like

## Extension Settings

I have not included any settings yet, because I have not seen the need for now.

## Known Issues

There are currently no issues. You may want to have a look at the GitHub issues section of this project to see if there are any.

You are also very welcome to create new issues if you have any problems, find bugs, or have a feature request.

## Roadmap / TODO

- Support conversion of multiple ASCII emojis or words at once
- Add images and GIFs to the README

> Also all issues on GitHub 😉
